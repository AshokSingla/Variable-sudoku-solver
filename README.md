# Variable-sudoku-solver
The user needs to choose the size of the sudoku solver viz 4, 9 ,16 ...(a square number)
next he needs to add the sudoku in form of consecutive numbers. a sample is shown in the code as well.
PS. A new way of entry is under process. This way is too irritating i know.
The result if exists would be displayed. There may be more than 1 solutions but the code will generate only 1 of those.
